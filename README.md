### Brief description of the system and its purpose

The **original purpose of building this code project** was to complete Assignment-Part 2 of the University of Birmingham's Building Usable Software course. During the development process, we built upon the project documentation from Assignment-Part 1 to design and implement three core modules: 

* **AI Dialogue**
* **Accessibility Support**
* **Cost of Living Support**

Detailed functionalities and implementation specifics of each module will be introduced in subsequent sections of the project's README.md file.

Throughout the development of this code prototype, we adhered to sound software design principles and architectural patterns. 

Regarding design principles, we **primarily implemented the Interface Segregation Principle and Open-Closed Principle.**

*  The Interface Segregation Principle ensured low coupling between modules, where each module only depends on minimal required interfaces, enhancing code maintainability and extensibility. 
* The Open-Closed Principle guarantees that the code can be conveniently extended and upgraded without modifying existing implementations.

In terms of architectural design, we **adopted the classic MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture**. This pattern separates application logic, user interface, and data storage, resulting in clearer code structure and easier development/maintenance.

Additionally, the **Decorator Pattern** was strictly followed throughout the project's development process.

Project implements one-to-many and inheritance relationships, and uses pytest to execute test cases.


### **How to Run This Project**

First, you need to download this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/JiaxinHou-123/BUS-GROUP-8.git
```

Then install the dependencies using pip，it is recommended to navigate to the project directory before running the command.":

```
cd BUS-GROUP-8
```

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
Then according to versions,please add package flask-wtf

```
pip install flask-wtf
```

To ensure the correct version of torch, please install it strictly in accordance with the instructions in the  [official documentation](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) .

Enter the following instructions in the terminal to run:

First, import the initial data into the database.

```
python debug_utils.py
```
Next,

```
python app.py
```

Due to considerations of computational resources, we built the project to run on a cloud server. To enable local computer access, we configured port forwarding. During actual runtime, you can use the following commands to retrieve the host and port information:

```
python app.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

The script contains test code. Test cases are in the folder of tests. Simply enter `pytest` in the terminal to run the test cases.

```
pytest
```

### Environmental configuration

This project is developed **using Python3.8.10, with the Flask framework constructing the backend architecture, and integrates PyTorch and ModelScope libraries to build core components of the AI dialogue system**. At the model level, we adopted the open-source [ChatGLM3-6b](https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM3) large language model (6-billion-parameter scale) from ZhipuAI as the foundational architecture. While model fine-tuning was omitted due to computational resource constraints and insufficient training data, the system maintains basic conversational functionality for standard interaction use cases.

For specific configuration requirements, please refer to the requirements.txt file



### A summary of implemented functionalities

###### AI Dialogue

For the AI Dialogue module, we have implemented conversational query and chat functionalities. Students can submit feedback through this interface, which is then stored in the backend's "datas/feedback.txt" file for subsequent analysis and processing.

###### Accessibility Support

The Accessibility Support Module implements the following functionalities: 

* Accessibility-related information (videos, photos, and text) is made available for user browsing and search operations; 
* An administrative interface enables authorized university staff to upload multimedia content (videos, images, and textual descriptions) documenting campus accessibility resources;
* Integrated search capabilities allow users to query up-to-date government allowances and grants, with automatic redirection functionality to relevant sections of the GOV.UK portal for official information access.
* Realize the feedback function

###### Cost of Living Support

The Cost of Living Support Module delivers the following key features: 

*  A budgeting utility provisioned by system administrators enables students to generate personalized living expense projections with tailored budgeting recommendations; 
  * Calculate the monthly/weekly/annual living expense budget based on students' quality of life needs. Students can switch the time units by themselves.
  * Realize the provision of allocation suggestions based on the current budget of students (retaining the calculator function), including referring to the weight of students' consumption preferences. If the predicted value exceeds the current budget, a reminder will be given
* Students can download selected multimedia content (instructional videos, infographics, and documents) uploaded by administrators that provide information on cost of living management strategies;
* An integrated portal provides access to auxiliary financial aid policies and campus employment resources, featuring a centralized repository for part-time job listings accompanied by CV optimization guidelines and automated application workflows via API integrations with university HR systems.
* The uploaded files can be read and deleted


###### Other

* The question-and-answer function of Accommodation has been implemented
* When a blank form is submitted, the indicated words will appear
* Import the database, log in and out, and register
* Realize user division, and different users see different interfaces
